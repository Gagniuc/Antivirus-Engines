Antivirus Engines: From Methods to Innovations, Design, and Applications


The book "Antivirus Engines: From Methods to Innovations, Design, and Applications" shows a comprehensive exploration of antivirus engine technologies and their evolution in response to the complex cyber threat landscape. While the first part of the book provides detailed foundational knowledge about operating systems, internet infrastructure, cryptography, and the historical context of malware and defenses, the second part stands out for its deep technical dive into the methodologies and novel solutions driving the next generation of antivirus detection and countermeasures.

In the second part, the book systematically dissects the full spectrum of detection techniques employed by modern antivirus engines, moving from classic signature-based scanning to advanced heuristic, algorithmic, and behavioral approaches. It presents in detail the algorithms behind signature matching, such as the use of hash tables, the Aho-Corasick algorithm, Bloom filters, and large-scale hash signature optimization, focusing on the scalability challenges as malware volumes soar. The text goes beyond mere description, presenting new comparative analyses of single and dual MD5/SHA signatures, recursive scan logic, and binary search on massive signature databases, introducing practical algorithms for real-world implementation.

The core novelty of the second part lies in its full treatment of innovative heuristic and AI-powered techniques. The book introduces and unpacks multiparametric heuristics, region-based and information-content-driven signature strategies, Markov chain analysis, perceptron-based heuristics, byte frequency analysis, and genetic algorithm-driven signature convergence—all supported by concrete example code and critical assessment of their detection accuracy. It further explores smart heuristics for context-aware file analysis (including header/extension discrepancies, file hiding, and archive content scanning), real-time process and behavior monitoring, and network-layer integration with process-port correlation. The chapters on disinfection mechanisms and malware banks (vaults, banks, and curator strategies) bring a unique perspective on resilience and post-infection remediation, rounding out the modern vision for autonomous, adaptive antivirus technologies.

Overall, the book’s latter half is a thorough, methodical reference for professionals and researchers looking to understand not just how antivirus engines function today, but where the frontier of detection methodology and automated malware analysis is headed. Novelty is reflected in the author’s blend of real-world engineering insight, practical algorithmic guidance, and forward-looking analysis of heuristic and machine learning models that are shaping the future of cybersecurity.
